====

FLIN is a simple extension that adds a button to Chrome which opens Netflix in a popout window, thus making it it's own neat, clean and minimalistic "player".

Version 1.0 brings with it new settings menu which allows you to run FLIN in "always-on-top" mode, due to popular demand.

How to Install
=======

1. Download the source files
2. Go to URL: chrome://extensions
3. Make sure that Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
4. Click Load unpacked extensions... to pop up a file-selection dialog.
5. Navigate to the source folder and select it. Press OK and extension should be installed.

Note
====

FLIN was taken down from Chrome store when Google updated it's policies regarding extensions and since I was using "Netflix" in the name and white 'N' on red background for icon I got hit as well to avoid this issue the name was changed and I asked Arttu (rautio.arttu@gmail.com) to create a new neutral logo, but since the original release Google has changed this extension policies and for now (11th of June, 2014) they do not allow extensions that open another website (e.g. www.netflix.com), I never though that this extension was pretty (or useful for that matter), but since the removal of the extension leaves ~1 500 weekly users hanging I decided to release the source so everyone who still wants to keep using the extension can still run it in developer mode.

Backstory
=========

For anyone interested when I first created this extension about an 9 months ago I made a silly little blog post about it which can be found [here] (http://topituulensuu.com/chrome-extension-netflix-popout)
